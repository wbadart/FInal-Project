SOFTWARE MANUAL
===============

*Overview* : To work with openGL, we used the panda3D engine. This engine is open source and has been used in large-scale online games (such as Disney's ToonTown and Pirates of the Caribbean). To use panda3D, we had to install numerous libraries before installing the panda3D software itself. There are a large number of libraries and header files that are accessed when using panda3D, so we will only touch on the major ones. By default, panda3D files are written in python, but we obviously worked in C++. Other than the overall lack of documentation on panda3D in C++, we did not run into too many problems.


*Libraries/Header files* : within /built/lib and /built/include

libp3dtool.so.1.9 / libp3dtoolconfig.so.1.9 : The core of panda3D, critical for all panda3D usage.

libp3framework.so.1.9 : Important for panda3D usage with C++, essential when trying to compile.

libp3tinydisplay.so.1.9 : Renders panda3D software.

libpandagl.so : Renders panda3D openGL
